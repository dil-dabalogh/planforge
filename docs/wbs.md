# PlanForge MVP - Project Retrospective  
**Completed:** A lightweight SPA for visual capacity and initiative planning with drag‑and‑drop timeline, dependencies, resource management, and JSON/YAML export.

---

## Project Summary

**Objective Achieved:** Delivered a self‑contained tool where users can:
- Add resources by category (Engineer, QA, PM)
- Define initiative hierarchy (Initiative > Epic > Story)
- Visualize dependencies and durations with drag/resizing
- Manage scenarios and export/import plans to JSON/YAML
